please ask on https://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow] or join us on the

== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-Code-Style[Spring Framework code format conventions].
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current `main` (or
  other target branch in the original project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).

== Working with the Code

=== Building from Source
start.spring.io can be build from the command line using
https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Apache Maven] on JDK 17 or above.
We include '`Maven Wrapper`' scripts (`./mvnw` or `mvnw.bat`) that you can run rather
than needing to install Maven locally.

==== Default Build
The project can be built from the root directory using the standard Maven command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw clean install
----

To start the site locally, execute the following command:

[indent=0]
----
    $ cd start-site
    $ ../mvnw spring-boot:run
----
