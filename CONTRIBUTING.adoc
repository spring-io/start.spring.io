= Contributing to start.spring.io

start.spring.io is released under the Apache 2.0 license. If you would like to contribute
something, or simply want to hack on the code this document should help you get started.

== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Proposal for New Entries
If you are maintaining an open source component, you can suggest the addition of a new
entry using a dedicated issue (Make sure to choose "New Entry Proposal"). If you are a
user of the component, please reach out to the team maintaining it.

New entries have to be discussed first via the dedicated template so please do not open a
Pull Request as a first step.

== Using GitHub issues
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage question
please ask on https://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow] or join us on the
https://gitter.im/spring-io/initializr[Gitter channel].

== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[sign the Contributor License Agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-Code-Style[Spring Framework code format conventions].
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current `main` (or
  other target branch in the original project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).

== Working with the Code

=== Building from Source
start.spring.io can be build from the command line using
https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Apache Maven] on JDK 17 or above.
We include '`Maven Wrapper`' scripts (`./mvnw` or `mvnw.bat`) that you can run rather
than needing to install Maven locally.

==== Default Build
The project can be built from the root directory using the standard Maven command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw clean install
----

To start the site locally, execute the following command:

[indent=0]
----
    $ cd start-site
    $ ../mvnw spring-boot:run
----
